# Relay

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to relay information to your LLM of choice.

### Features

1. Setting inference engine of choice

2. Setting custom settings such as: system prompt, sampling parameters (temperature, top_k, etc.)

3. Embedding support, generation

4. Vector store support for Milvis Vector DB
- ideally we switch to vector support to our Postgres Database, and it uses pgvector


## Supported

- Currently only support loading huggingface models
    - by default these are stored in .cache/huggingface/hub
        - that is where the repo references files from for loading text generation


# Requires

## Environment Variables:

1. request_validation_private_key
    - this is used to verify the signature for the incoming request
    - a backend server and relay must both have the same private key to properly validate request logic

# Configuration
- src/config

1. constants.py
    - this file shouldn't really be changed that much

2. config.json (config.json.enc recommended)

    - this file can change, and there are api routes that allow changing this file directly

    - the most important parts of information it stores is:
        - api_keys, models, full_prompts

# Run

python3 -m venv EGCenv

source EGCenv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py



# Control Flow

REQUEST -> main -> router -> controller/model -> components 

RESPONSE -> component -> controller/model -> router -> main


# DB
Will have the connection to postgres (asyncpg) and milvus (pymilvus)
- your backend server should have the connection to the database

https://magicstack.github.io/asyncpg/current/
https://milvus.io/docs/manage_connection.md













# Python Env

python3 -m venv pyenv

source pyenv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

pip install -v .


deepspeed-mii==0.1.0


# VM instructions:

1. Clone repo:

git clone https://github.com/PersonaEnterprises/egirls-chat.git

2. Run:

chmod +x setup.sh

./setup.sh

OR

apt-get update

apt-get install vim -y

cd egirls-chat

python3 -m venv pyenv

source pyenv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py

## Ports that need to be exposed:

- load balancer port: 50050

- restful gateway port: 51080

- server port: 50051

- zmq port: 25555

- master port: 29500

ports to expose:

8888,50050,51080,50051,25555,29500



# TODO
1. Figure out finetuning & calibration dataset for AutoAWQ
2. Calibrate system prompt with identifiers on every section
    - world description
    - general description
2. Function Calling
    - image generation (gen_img)
        - textual inversion reference [char]
    - long term memory (gen_memory) (can be texts or images)
3. Train small memory model
    - Mistral 7b?
    - LSTM?
4. Async VLLM engine support
    - make your own api
    - keep it simple, use ansible playbook to bootstrap models, manage secrets with something, etc.
    - use github ci/cd
5. UNIQUELY Recognizing user images

Tasks:
  1. gen_img
  2. gen_memory
  3. voice_emotion
  - flexible style control

Memory:
1. run semantic similarity search on the long term memory vector storage for {user > AI character}
2. update `long_term_memory` section of the system prompt with the results of the search
3. generate output

Sub Prompts:
- Break up the large system promot into component prompts:
https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2/blob/master/examples/chat_formatting.py
https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2/blob/master/examples/chat_prompts.py

- add conversation history to system prompt:
  - add latest 20 messages to conversation
    - set max_token limit on ALL messages, user and assistant, to have consistent cap on context length
    - probably better to take x amount of tokens from the last y messages, do a cutoff where applicable
